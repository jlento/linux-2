# Online Study group format

Programming is best learned by doing. The emphasis in this course is not on the
lectures (slides only). The students will need to search information
independently, to find the answers to the questions in the lecture material and
in the exercises. This reflects more accurately the situation in which the
skills are needed in practice. After students have proposed different answers
and solutions, we discuss their merits together.

Having access to a Linux terminal is mandatory for solving the
exercises, and very useful for answerng the more general questions, too.


# Independent study

Independent does not mean alone, quite the opposite. Please answer
the questions in the lecture notes and do the exercises together in
small groups and/or use the course discussion forum to exchange ideas
and ask for help. The lecturers follow the forum too, to comment and
help if needed.


# Resources

- Zoom meetings, discussion and live demos in Zoom. Link in the e-learn course
  page.


# A fair warning

Some of the questions and exercises may be really hard. In the worst
case they may even require you to read lecturers mind. This is
intentional. If you get stuck, start a thread in the discussion forum,
and go to the next question or exercise. Return to the hard problem
when you get some help on how to proceed.

Important: Your answers and solutions don't need to be perfect -- shell scripts
rarely are, in reality. It is as helpful to figure out what goes wrong with a
misbehaving script as to study perfect scripts.

Even more important: Be brave to ask questions, and help your fellow's when they
get stuck.
